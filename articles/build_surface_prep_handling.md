>- **:warning: Thoroughly wash all print surfaces with dish soap and water**.
>    - You should do this **even for brand new surfaces.**
>    - Use some elbow grease, especially with textured plates. Scrub thoroughly in small circles and then rinse.*
>    - :warning: Don't dry it using cloth. Many laundry products contain fats, oils, or waxes. You may use paper towels\*\*, or preferably, **air dry it**.
>- :warning: Avoid touching your build surface as much as possible. Oils from your fingers will cause adhesion issues. Pick it up using the tabs, or by the sides. You may also handle it with paper towels**
>- Isopropyl alcohol does not do a great job of cleaning oils. It's okay for maintenance, but you should still plan to wash it occasionally.

\* *If your build surface is not detachable, carefully spritz it with water or use isopropyl alcohol. Be thorough - you don't want any remaining soap residue.*\
\*\* *Some brands of paper towels contain conditioners that may cause issues.*

### Smooth PEI

- **Consider scuffing it up** with a [:page_facing_up: kitchen scouring pad](https://www.scotch-brite.com/3M/en_US/scotch-brite/tools/~/Scotch-Brite-Heavy-Duty-Scour-Pad/?N=4337+3294529207+3294631680&rt=rud).

    - **This helps immensely**, much like how you would scuff/sand a surface before painting or gluing something to it.

    - Some people choose not to do this, to keep the glass-like surface finish on their prints. However, *you will be sacrificing adhesion* and may need to use brims and/or adhesives on occasion.

    - ~800-1000 grit sandpaper or the scrubby side of a fresh sponge may also work.

    - You can refresh the surface this way on occasion, just remember to wash it again afterwards.

    - You should probably keep the scouring pad/sponge out of the kitchen afterwards. I'm not sure the health effects of plastic dust ending up on your dishes - better safe than sorry!
