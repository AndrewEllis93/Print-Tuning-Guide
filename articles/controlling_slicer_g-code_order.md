# Controlling Slicer Temperature G-Code Order (Simple Method)

**The method shown in the [:page_facing_up:"Passing Slicer Variables to PRINT_START"](/articles/passing_slicer_variables.md) instructions is generally the preferable way to set it up**, as it allows you the most control, but it is more complex.

If your slicer is putting heating g-codes AFTER `PRINT_START` and you want them to happen before (or the inverse, or you want to split it), this would be a simpler way to control the ordering. This method only allows you to send temperature g-codes before or after `PRINT_START`.

To force the g-code ordering, place any of the following g-codes from the following lists in your start gcode where you desire:
## Prusa Slicer / SuperSlicer
- `M140 S[first_layer_bed_temperature] ; set bed temp`
- `M190 S[first_layer_bed_temperature] ; wait for bed`
- `M104 S{first_layer_temperature[initial_extruder]+extruder_temperature_offset[initial_extruder]} ; set hotend temp`
- `M109 S{first_layer_temperature[initial_extruder]+extruder_temperature_offset[initial_extruder]} ; wait for hotend `
## Cura
- `M140 S{material_bed_temperature_layer_0} ; set bed temp`
- `M190 S{material_bed_temperature_layer_0} ; wait for bed`
- `M104 S{material_print_temperature_layer_0} ; set hotend temp`
- `M109 S{material_print_temperature_layer_0} ; wait for hotend `

## Warnings
- **These are just lists** of available commands, they don't have to be in this order, nor do you have to use all of them. Place them as you like.
- Each bullet point is only **ONE** line. Do not split them into multiple lines.
- There are many other variables available in each slicer, and you can pass whatever variables you like to whatever g-codes you like. The available variables are not always documented.
## Example
Forces both bed and hotend to heat up fully before executing `PRINT_START` (SS):
