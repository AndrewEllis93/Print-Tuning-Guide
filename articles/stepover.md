# Stepover

I just thought this needed more awareness, it seems a lot of people don't know about it. 

This video by Maker's Muse explains it better than I ever could:

- https://youtu.be/YPAXeBuq9qU?t=612

### **Just watch the stepover bit.**
- I have absolutely nothing against Angus personally — in fact I watch a lot of his videos —  **but I think there are some misconceptions being perpetuated in other parts of that video.**

    - Some of his points directly contradict parts of this guide, so I wanted to mention it to avoid confusion (specifically axis esteps, flow/extrusion multiplier, and horizontal expansion.)
