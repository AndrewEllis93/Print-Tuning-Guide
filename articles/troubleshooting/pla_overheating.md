# PLA is Overheating
- Open the front door at minimum. Or take off all the side panels.
- Use [:page_facing_up:AB-BN](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Badnoob/AB-BN) or another cooling mod, or:
- Point a fan at it.
    - Don't go too crazy, or your bed heater might not be able to keep up.
