- Open the front door at minimum. Or take off all the side panels.
- If you are using Afterburner, try [:page_facing_up: AB-BN](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Badnoob/AB-BN) or another cooling mod, or upgrade to Stealthburner.
- Point a fan at it.
    - Don't go too crazy, or your bed heater might not be able to keep up.

- You can also try printing with the bed heater turned off.
