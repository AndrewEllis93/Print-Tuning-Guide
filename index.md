# Introduction

This guide was originally written for the Voron community. Much of the guide has been expanded to work for all printers, but some notes and hardware troubleshooting tips are still Voron or Klipper specific.

## Notes

- My SuperSlicer profiles are located [:page_facing_up: here](https://github.com/AndrewEllis93/Ellis-SuperSlicer-Profiles).

- If you have issues, comments, or suggestions about the guide, please let me know on GitHub issues or via Discord: [:page_facing_up: Ellis#4980](https://discordapp.com/users/207622442842062849)
  - For issues **not directly related to the guide content itself**, or for troubleshooting & print help, please use the public help channels in the [:page_facing_up: Voron Discord](https://discord.gg/voron) (or the appropriate community for your printer).
- You can find the bed models and textures I am using [:page_facing_up: here](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Extras/tree/main/Bed_Models). The bed texture I am using in some of the older screenshots is from [:page_facing_up: VoronUsers.](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/slicer_configurations/PrusaSlicer/hartk1213/V0/Bed_Shape)
